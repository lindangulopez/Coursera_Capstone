## Ready for a career in data science with demonstrated ability to solve for real-world problems. 

Real world data was analysed with inferential statistical testing by k-means clustering. Each neighbourhood’s closest match within boroughs was 
sought by venues. [Machine Learning was used to cluster the neighbourhoods](https://lindangulopez.github.io/testing-page/map_clusters.html) and a Tailor-Made Liveability Indicator was applied to the clusters to 
make recommendations on relocation options with [Word Clouds](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/), i.e. text clouds or tag clouds.  The Word Cloud were created with 640 words from the 
[EIU’s Liveability Index](https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=Liveability17) and 360 words from the venue data sets, for each neighbourhood, borough and the cities of New York, Toronto and Paris. 


So, a list of 1000 words were used to generate the merged word clouds and 360 words for the venue only word clouds.

After much data mining, munging and visualizations the bias of the EIU’s index was revealed. It shows a clear preference for lower density and
less built up cities, like Toronto over the big buzz in the Big Apple. As he EIU's Liveability Index focus on the the challenges that are faced 
in a big city it rated Toronto, Paris and New York as 4th, 29th and 55th respectively, leagues apart!
