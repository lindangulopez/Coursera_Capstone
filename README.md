## Ready for a career in data science with demonstrated ability to solve for real-world problems. 

After much data mining, munging and visualizations the bias of the EIU’s index was revealed. It shows a clear preference for lower density and
less built up cities, like Toronto over the big buzz in the Big Apple. As he EIU's Liveability Index focus on the the challenges that are faced 
in a big city it rated Toronto, Paris and New York as 4th, 29th and 55th respectively, leagues apart!

But as their tailor made word cloud intergrated that ‘big city buzz’ factor it was a better tool for decision making. Here is an aerial view of 
Battery Park City one of the cluster 3 (red) neighbourhoods of New York, Manhattan.


It was pushed, as it had important parks and interesting venues and offered suburban living in the Heart of New York City comparable to that of 
Reuilly, Paris.
